# Rag_youtube

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that processes YouTube videos to enable question-answering capabilities.  
It extracts audio from a given YouTube URL, transcribes the content, and allows users to ask questions based on the video's content.

## Features

- **YouTube Video Processing**: Input a YouTube URL to extract and process video content.
- **Audio Transcription**: Converts video audio into text using speech-to-text models.
- **Vector Embedding**: Transforms transcribed text into vector embeddings for efficient retrieval.
- **Question Answering**: Utilizes a language model to answer user queries based on the video content.
- **Dockerized Setup**: Easily deployable using Docker.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sharmax-vikas/Rag_youtube.git
   cd Rag_youtube

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a .env file and add your API keys and configurations.

3. **Install Dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Run the Application**:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    
5. **Alternatively, use Docker**:

    ```bash
      docker build -t rag_youtube .
      docker run -p 8501:8501 rag_youtube
      
# Usage
1. Access the application at http://localhost:8501.

2. Enter a YouTube video URL.

3. The system will process the video and prepare it for question answering.

4. Input your questions related to the video content.

5. Receive answers generated by the language model based on the video.

# Technologies Used
**Python**: Core programming language.

Docker: Containerization for easy deployment.

Speech-to-Text Models: For transcribing video audio.

Vector Databases: For storing and retrieving text embeddings.

Language Models: For generating answers to user queries.
